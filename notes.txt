need a data structure to hold the orders that are not completed yet

highest buyers and the lowest sellers are matched and the price is set at the price of the last transaction

if there are no entries on the opposite side, new exec report
if a selling order is higher than the highest buying order, new exec report
if a buying order is lower than the lowest selling order, new exec report

if the order executes fully or partially, new entries must not be entered
if the order executes fully, the order is removed from the book (remove the order from the data structure)
if the order executes partially, the remaining quantity is left on the book (update the quantity of the order)

the price is set as the price of the order in the book that was entered first(data structure)
data structure should sort the orders by price and time
buying orders should be sorted in descending order and first come first serve for same price
selling orders should be sorted in ascending order and first come first serve for same price
